# Country API

## Overview

A country API that allows you to add, remove and view countries.

## Getting Started 

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- NPM 
- A cloud database hosting platform such as [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)

### How to install

1. Clone the repo
    - Run `git clone your SSH_github_url` in the CLI of your choice

2. Navigate to the project directory
    -  Navigate to the project with `cd country_api`

3. Install the dependencies
    - Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies for the project
    - This project uses:
        - Express
        - PG
        - CORS
        - dotenv
        - nodemon for development
    - `npm i express cors dotenv pg` & `npm i -D nodemon` 

4. Setup your database 
    - Create a database on Supabase, or other cloud-based database management system platform
    - Retrieve the database URL and copy it 
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:
        - `DB_URL=<your database_url>`
    - Replace `<your_database_url>` with the database URL you have just copied from Supabase
    - Run `npm run setup-db` to setup the database

5. Setup your port
    - Add a `PORT` key assigned to the port of your choice in the .env file
        - `PORT=<port_of_your_choice>`

6. Run the server
    - Run `npm run dev` to run the server in the development mode, this uses nodemon when making changes
    -Run `npm run start` to run the server in production mode, this only runs once and close connection immediately after
